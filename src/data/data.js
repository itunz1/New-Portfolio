        by any user, in this section if you are registered you can add/remove the article to
        favorites, leave comments, reviews and push the buy button, if you decide to buy the
        article you are redirected to fill a form to contact the seller and you will receive an email
        with all the instructions, also you can see the seller reputation from 0 to 5 stars.
        In colaboration with the team in the back to make sure that all the data is working
        correctly, i made the form to post your vehicle implementing all the validations needed.
